# Infi Emulator DOJO

Make sure that Docker is installed on your machine and then run ```install-server```, which builds a Docker image that serves the emulator on port ```3000```. When the installer is done, the server can be started by running ```run-server```, which binds the server on host-port ```3000```. When you've opened ```localhost:3000``` in your browser, every change to any HTML or JS-file will result in a browser refresh.
